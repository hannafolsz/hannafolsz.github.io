Welcome! I am a 4th-year PhD Candidate in Political Science at Stanford University. My dissertation focuses on opposition party strategies in countries experiencing democratic backsliding in East-Central Europe. My wider research interests include the determinants and consequences of democratic erosion, media control, corruption, and accountability in East-Central Europe and Latin America. My work applies modern causal inference, text analysis, and geospatial techniques. I hold a B.A. in Economics and Politics from Durham University and an MSc in Political Science and Political Economy from the London School of Economics.

I co-organize [EEPWG](https://eepg-workshop.github.io), the East European Politics Graduate Workshop. At Stanford, I am a member of [PovGov](https://povgov.com) (Poverty, Violence, and Governance Lab) and [DPL](https://stanforddpl.org) (Democracy and Polarization Lab).

You can contact me via email at [hfolsz@stanford.edu](mailto:hfolsz@stanford.edu). I always welcome opportunities to talk about applying to Stanford's Political Science PhD with prospective POC, FLI, and international applicants, so please feel free to email me.
