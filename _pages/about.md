Welcome! I am Hanna Folsz, 4th-year PhD Candidate in Political Science at Stanford University. My research interests are focused on democratic backsliding and opposition party strategies. I am interested in understanding how 


the political economy of accountability, corruption, and democratic backsliding. She is interested in understanding the determinants of effective democratic accountability, the role of money in politics, and processes of democratic erosion in Latin America and Eastern Europe. My work applies modern causal inference, text analysis, and geospatial techniques. I hold a B.A. in Economics and Politics from Durham University and an MSc in Political Science and Political Economy from the London School of Economics. You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Baj461kn5utXWXphjKnki9U6di4K1eWp/view?usp=sharing). 

I co-organize the [EEPWG](https://eepg-workshop.github.io), the East European Politics Graduate Workshop. At Stanford, I am a member of [PovGov](https://povgov.com) (Poverty, Violence, and Governance Lab), and [DPL](https://stanforddpl.org) (Democracy and Polarization Lab).
