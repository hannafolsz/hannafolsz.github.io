Welcome! I am a 6th-year PhD Candidate in Political Science at Stanford University and a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law. My research analyzes large datasets with modern quantitative tools to study opposition movements against authoritarian power grabs and sources of resilience against democratic backsliding in East-Central Europe and Latin America. My research has been published in the _Election Law Journal_ and is under revision for resubmission at the _Journal of Politics_.

My dissertation, supported by the _APSA-NSF Dissertation Research Improvement Grant_, develops a theory of the _opposition trap_ to explain why established opposition parties routinely fail to mount successful electoral challenges in autocratizing regimes despite often decades of past election successes, while new challengers more frequently defeat aspiring autocrats. I bring evidence from Hungary's contemporary episode of democratic decline, combining large-N datasets, including large text corpora, and causal research designs, along with an original elite survey, mass surveys, and qualitative evidence. 

I co-founded and continue to co-organize the [East European Politics Graduate Workshop](https://eepg-workshop.github.io). At Stanford, I am a member of the [Poverty, Violence, and Governance Lab](https://povgov.com) and the [Democracy and Polarization Lab](https://stanforddpl.org). I grew up in Budapest, Hungary, before moving to the UK for the first half of my studies. Beyond English and Hungarian, I speak Polish, Spanish, French, and German.

If you have any questions about my research, pursuing a PhD in political science, or anything else, please email me at [hfolsz@stanford.edu](mailto:hfolsz@stanford.edu).
